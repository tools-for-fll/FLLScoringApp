        This application can be installed to your device by following these
        simple steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Click on the share button at the bottom center of the browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scroll down and select "Add to Home Screen" from the menu that pops
            up.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select "Add" to install this application to the home screen.
          </li>
        </ol>
        The benefit of installing as an application is the ability to use it
        even when you do not have a network connection (for exmple, in some
        schools).

        PREAMBLE
      </p>
      <p>
        The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
        development of collaborative font projects, to support the font
        creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide
        a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in
        partnership with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
        redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
        fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
        redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
        names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
        however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
        requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to
        any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
      </p>

        <li>
          Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
          redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
          contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
          included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
          in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
          binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the

        </li>
        <li>
          No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
